I've created most of the classes from the UML diagram in the technical plan but their methods are still undefined.
Also, (re)learned some Scala Swing, but I'm thinking I might switch to ScalaFX.
Nothing that can error yet.
Spent around 3-4 hours.
Probably behind schedule but should be easy enough to catch up. Been busy with other courses.

20.3.2023
I've switched the GUI from Swing to ScalaFX and started implementing most methods in pretty much every class.
Deviated from the plan since the program is rather reliant on having most classes functioning rather than completing and then testing one at a time.
Fairly happy with the current progress.
Spent around 8-9 hours.
Done with lab assignments in physics, so I'll have more time for this project now.

The FileReader is working now, I've implemented a file chooser into the GUI and started working on drawing projects. Think I'll refactor the IDObject/Shape classes to directly utilize Graphics2D objects directly.
Somewhat working backwards because the GUI is not very fun to work with :D
Not awful progress but definitely needed more time spent on it. Luckily I'll have a ton of free time in the next 2 weeks.
3-4 hours.

I've added mouse dragging shapes and editing properties (pos, scale) via keyboard input but javafx's node-on-node coordinate system is giving me trouble.
Shapes have coordinates, but if said shape is inside another pane node then the only coordinates available are getLayoutX/Y & getTranslateX/Y which both return 0, 0 regardless of the shape's initial location.
the scaleX / scaleY methods also scale out both ways from the center while retaining the original translate/layout coordinates meaning my borders don't work.
Started work on ObjectNode (stackpane) to hopefully handle transformations via mouse (i.e. circles in the corners of a rectangle that let you transform it)
My initial technical plan isn't working out particularly well for the Project backend as turning a file into a Project class and then most of its information again into the GUI seems somewhat redundant given the graphical nature of the application.
I'll probably need to request a time extension for this :(
~15+ hours including a lot of scalafx/javafx tutorials & stackoverflow.

8.5.2023
I've replaced scale transforms with methods in the ObjectNode class, so they're still in scale 1.0 in the output Pane,
meaning I can probably implement some form of zoom in/out. Otherwise added a bunch of functions like adding ovals, rectangles,
refactored event handling & more QOL changes. Main things that still need implementation are layers/object overlapping, file saving,
scale set (how much 1m is on screen), rotation & if I have time then the object editor.
Finally feeling better & without a fever today so I'll be trying to power through this from today till Sunday.
~20 hours maybe? Most of it spent trying to figure out scalafx classes & methods and the odd way nodes change between javafx and scalafx implementations.
