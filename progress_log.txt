I've created most of the classes from the UML diagram in the technical plan but their methods are still undefined.
Also, (re)learned some Scala Swing, but I'm thinking I might switch to ScalaFX.
Nothing that can error yet.
Spent around 3-4 hours.
Probably behind schedule but should be easy enough to catch up. Been busy with other courses.

I've switched the GUI from Swing to ScalaFX and started implementing most methods in pretty much every class.
Deviated from the plan since the program is rather reliant on having most classes functioning rather than completing and then testing one at a time.
Fairly happy with the current progress.
Spent around 8-9 hours.
Done with lab assignments in physics, so I'll have more time for this project now.
