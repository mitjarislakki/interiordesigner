I've created most of the classes from the UML diagram in the technical plan but their methods are still undefined.
Also (re)learned some Scala Swing, but I'm thinking I might switch to ScalaFX.
Nothing that can error yet.
Spent around 3-4 hours.
Probably behind schedule but should be easy enough to catch up.
